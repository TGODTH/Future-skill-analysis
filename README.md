# Future Skill Analysis: A Collaborative Data Science Project
This project is a testament to my abilities in programming, teaching, coaching, and data analysis. I collaborated with a friend who was applying for a Data Science program at a university. As my friend had no prior programming experience, I took on the role of teaching and coaching him while also handling the programming aspect of the project.

## The Project
We decided to create a web scraping project that extracts data from an online course website and uses it to create a dashboard in Google Looker Studio. The project involved several key skills that I helped my friend develop.

### Programming
I taught my friend the basics of Python and wrote a web scraping script that uses the requests and csv libraries to extract data from the website. I also helped him troubleshoot issues that he encountered while developing his portfolio project.

### Teaching & Coaching
I shared my knowledge of programming with my friend and guided him through the project by asking questions and giving feedback on his work. I challenged him to come up with ideas and solutions on his own and helped him develop critical thinking skills.

### Data Analysis
After scraping the data, we used Google Looker Studio to create a dashboard and analyze the data. We identified trends and patterns in the courses offered and used this information to make recommendations for future course development.

### Web Structure & Network Basics
To extract data from the website, we needed to understand its structure and how it interacts with the network. I showed my friend how to use F12 to find the HTTP GET method that gets data from the backend of the website.

## Project Details
* The web scraping script is written in Python and uses the requests and csv libraries to extract data from an online course website.
* The data is stored in a CSV file, which is used to create a dashboard in Google Looker Studio.
* The dashboard contains various charts and graphs that provide insights into the courses offered on the website. Here is the link to the dashboard: https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/e242a2d2-3443-418a-8052-c4858868a965.

## Accomplishments
This project showcases my skills in programming, teaching, coaching, and data analysis. It demonstrates my ability to work collaboratively on a project and develop solutions to complex problems. Specifically, I was able to:

* Teach and coach someone with no programming experience and guide them towards a successful portfolio project.
* Write a Python web scraping script that extracts data from an online course website using requests and csv libraries.
* Use Google Looker Studio to create a dashboard that provides insights into the courses offered on the website.
* Analyze the data to identify trends and patterns and make recommendations for future course development.
* Understand the structure of the website and its interaction with the network to extract data using HTTP GET method.

Overall, this project highlights my ability to collaborate, learn new skills, and apply them to real-world problems.
