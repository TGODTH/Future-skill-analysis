# Future-skill-analysis

This is a project that I worked on with a friend who was applying for a Data Science program at a university. As he had no prior programming experience, I helped him develop a portfolio project idea, taught him programming skills, and coached him through the project.

## Skills Utilized
* Programming: I taught my friend the basics of Python and wrote a web scraping script to extract data from an online course website. I also helped him troubleshoot issues that he encountered while developing his portfolio project.
* Teaching & Coaching: I shared my knowledge of programming with my friend, and guided him through the project by asking questions and giving feedback on his work. I also helped him develop critical thinking skills by challenging him to come up with ideas and solutions on his own.
* Data Analysis: After scraping the data, we used Google Looker Studio to create a dashboard and analyze the data. We identified trends and patterns in the courses offered, and used this information to make recommendations for future course development.

## Project Details
* The web scraping script is written in Python and uses the requests and csv libraries to extract data from an online course website.
* The data is stored in a CSV file, which is used to create a dashboard in Google Looker Studio.
* The dashboard contains various charts and graphs that provide insights into the courses offered on the website.

Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in programming, teaching, coaching, and data analysis. It also showcases my ability to work collaboratively on a project and develop solutions to complex problems.
